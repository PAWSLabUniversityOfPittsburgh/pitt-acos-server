Logging key generator
=====================

With this tool, you can create a keypair for logging and retrieving the log files. When
an activity is launched, a logging key can be specified. All the activities launched
with the same logging key will save the submitted logs to the same logging store.
It is possible to download all the logs from the specific logging store by using
the secret key.
