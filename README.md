# ï»¿Acos - Advanced Content Server

Forked from https://github.com/acos-server/acos-server, the original ACOS Server repository. 

This version is created to mainly enhance the LTI capabilities of the ACOS server and for additional local changes needed, that are unique to PAWS and collaborators' needs. 

This version serves multiple content through LTI protocol and can be accessed from Canvas or any other LMS with LTI support. 

Currently, this version is running at Virginia Tech and can be accessed at [here](https://acos.cs.vt.edu/)https://acos.cs.vt.edu/.
